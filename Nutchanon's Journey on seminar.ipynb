    "My journery to these three topics was something special. I dreamt, googled and decised whether those topics are really ready for production or not.  I have big interest in those, but I need to go with one topic I thought most suitable for me at that time. This is hard moment for me. My conclusion is that; **Finance**, particularly trading in equities, option and other securities can be done later in my freetime. **Chatbot**, particularly Thai language chatbot; this one is not really in my attention anymore because Thai NLP is so WEAK. The comunity don't even share their source code. So, it would be amazingly waste of time to push this. **Deep learning**, I mysterously fell in love with this topic. Althrough, at first it appeared that this topic is too new, too reasearch and too theory. But, at the end I found a good learning resource. So, I can get back on the track of master it."
